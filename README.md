 ## Description.
 A simple app in which using the GitHub API you get a list of members of the organization Adalab and through a "input select" you can filter them by name. When you select one of them, its data is shown in a small card.

Each card consists of the name and surname, location, username, number of repositories, followers and following and the time you have been a member of GitHub. In addition to an icon of GitHub, which takes us to your page.
